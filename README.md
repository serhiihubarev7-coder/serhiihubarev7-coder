### What I Build

#### End-to-End Automations  
From lead capture ‚Üí enrichment ‚Üí CRM updates ‚Üí scoring ‚Üí sales routing.  
I build orchestration pipelines that connect tools and maintain data accuracy.

#### Multi-Agent Systems  
Planner‚Äìexecutor architectures, tool-using agents, autonomous data processors, and collaborative task routing.

#### Back-Office Automation  
Finance approvals, invoice parsing, payroll reconciliation, and contract lifecycle management.

#### Customer Operations  
Ticket triage, automated replies, routing logic, and intelligent knowledge retrieval.

#### Document Intelligence  
PDF parsing, OCR, classification, data extraction, validation, and structured storage pipelines.

#### Data Pipelines & Analytics  
Real-time ETL/ELT, dbt modeling, anomaly detection, and auto-updating KPI dashboards.
